Raisin Master
#############################

Introduction
==============

Raisin Master is a fast, lightweight build system designed to replace colcon in ROS2.
It leverages the efficiency of CMake by acting as a CMake script generator to streamline the build process for raisin-based projects.
In essence, Raisin Master is powered by Python scripts that set up the CMake build environment and provide helper functions.
All you need to get started is knowledge of CMake.

**Key Benefits**

- **Faster Build Times Compared to Colcon+ROS2**: Since Raisin Master simply generates CMake scripts, its performance is as fast as CMake itself. Script generation typically takes less than a second, and builds can be further accelerated with ninja-build <https://ninja-build.org/>_, the recommended tool. Although detailed benchmarks are pending, our internal project compiles in about 35 seconds with Raisin Master versus over 4 minutes with colcon. Improved message and service handling also contribute to its speed.
- **IDE Support**: Being almost entirely implemented in pure CMake, Raisin Master integrates seamlessly with popular IDEs such as CLion and VSCode. This enables advanced debugging features like pausing execution, setting breakpoints, and evaluating variables in real time.
- **No Installation Required**: Simply clone the repository and start using Raisin Master immediately. There is no bulky installation process; removing the directory completely eliminates all components of Raisin Master.
- **Streamlined Development Workflow**: Unlike colcon, which installs every package it builds, Raisin Master installs packages only when you are ready to release your software. This avoids unnecessary file duplication (e.g., header files) that could confuse both the IDE and the user, while reducing overhead.
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Many existing C++ packages support CMake but not colcon. Most modern CMake packages already satisfy the requirements for a Raisin package, allowing for straightforward integration with Raisin Master. Additionally, utilities are provided to convert existing ROS2 packages into Raisin packages.

Directory Structure
The following directories and files are part of Raisin Master:

- ``include``: Contains header files for directory and time management.

- ``install``: All Raisin packages are installed in this folder. Raisin Master's CMake configuration enforces that the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX points to this directory.

- ``src``: Holds all Raisin packages.

- ``templates``: Contains templates for generating message, service, and CMake files.

- ``messages``: Stores basic and common message and service definitions.

- ``generated``: Contains generated message and service files, which are produced from the definitions and used in C++ code.

- ``log``: Logging data from the packages will go here.

- ``commands/``: Contains modular command implementations for the RAISIN CLI. Each module is self-contained with both business logic and CLI definitions:

    - ``setup.py``: Generates message headers and configures CMakeLists.txt
    - ``build.py``: Compiles the project using CMake and Ninja
    - ``install.py``: Downloads and installs packages from GitHub releases
    - ``publish.py``: Builds, packages, and uploads releases to GitHub
    - ``index.py``: Lists available packages (local or remote)
    - ``git_commands.py``: Git repository operations across multiple repos
    - ``help.py``: Displays help messages
    - ``utils.py``: Shared utility functions
    - ``globals.py``: Global state management
    - ``constants.py``: Constant definitions

- ``raisin.py``: The main entry point for RAISIN CLI. This file registers all commands from the ``commands/`` package and uses Click framework for a researcher-friendly command-line interface. Before building any Raisin packages, run the setup command which performs the following tasks:

    - Convert Message Definitions: Transforms message definitions into corresponding message header files.
    - Generate the Master CMakeLists.txt File: Automatically adds all projects from the src directory to the CMakeLists.txt file using add_subdirectory(). The script organizes packages based on their dependencies by parsing each package's CMakeLists.txt file. (It ignores the packages inside **RAISIN_IGNORE**)
    - Create a Release File: Generates a release.txt file that lists the commit hash for each Git repository within the src directory.
    - Copy Resource Directories: Copy the resource, config, and scripts directories from each package in the src directory to install directory.

- ``raisin.sh``: A bash wrapper script for easier command-line usage. Run ``./raisin.sh <command>`` instead of ``python3 raisin.py <command>``.

Note that some directories are created during runtime and you might not see them at first.

Raisin Package
==============

A Raisin package is a set of files in a directory containing a CMakeLists.txt file—even if the file is empty.
Note that subdirectories within a Raisin package cannot be treated as separate Raisin packages.

A typical raisin package looks like this

.. code-block:: text

    my_project/
    ├── resource/
    ├── scripts/
    ├── config/
    ├── msg/
    ├── srv/
    ├── include/
    ├   └── my_project/
    ├       └── my_project.hpp
    ├── src/
    ├   └── my_project.cpp
    └── CMakeLists.txt

Requirements for a Raisin package include:

1. **Directory Structure**:
Header files must reside in the ``include/${PROJECT_NAME}/`` directory.
Source files should be placed in the ``src`` directory.

2. **Resource Organization**:
Resources should be stored in the ``resource`` directory.
Python and Bash scripts should be located in the ``scripts`` directory.
Parameter files should be placed in the ``config`` directory.
Message files should be placed in the ``msg`` directory.
Service files should be placed in the ``srv`` directory.
Explanation about messages and services will be given in the Raisin Network section.

3. **Naming Conventions**:
The project name must match the name of the Raisin package directory.

4. **Dependency Management**:
Use ``raisin_find_package`` (instead of the standard ``find_package``) to locate other Raisin packages.
``raisin_find_package``is explained further in the following section.


CMakeLists file
=================

There are no constraints on the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file
Below is an example of a typical ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for a Raisin package:

.. code-block:: cmake

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
    project(raisin_package)

    find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
    find_package(yaml-cpp REQUIRED)
    raisin_find_package(raisin_dependencies REQUIRED)

    add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} SHARED
      src/raisin_package.cpp
    )

    set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} yaml-cpp raisim::raisim raisin_dependencies)
    target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
            "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>"
            "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>")

    raisin_install(${PROJECT_NAME} Eigen3 yaml-cpp raisin_master)

In this file, ``raisin_find_package`` runs ``find_package`` under the hood if the library is not part of the build targets, in other words, if it does nothing if the dependency is not part of the build.

``raisin_install`` performs several commands necessary for install the package,
like creating the config file, installing the ``include`` directory, defining the export set, etc.
What follows after ``${PROJECT_NAME}`` are the dependencies.
The auto-generated config file will call ``find_package`` for each dependencies.
The definitions can be found in ``cmake/raisin_helper``

There is also an expert version of ``raisin_install``.
An example follows:

.. code-block:: cmake

    raisin_install_config_string(${PROJECT_NAME} "
        raisin_find_package(raisim REQUIRED)
        get_filename_component(RAISIN_INSTALL_DIR \"\${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}\" DIRECTORY)
        get_filename_component(RAISIN_INSTALL_DIR \"\${RAISIN_INSTALL_DIR}/../..\" ABSOLUTE)
        add_compile_definitions(\${PROJECT_NAME} INTERFACE \"RAISIN_INSTALL_DIR=\${RAISIN_INSTALL_DIR}/\")
    ")

``raisin_install_config_string`` lets you customize the config file.
The string will be added to the config file.


Workflow: Setup, Install, and Build
====================================

RAISIN Master now uses a Click-based CLI for a more intuitive and researcher-friendly experience. The typical workflow follows three steps: **Setup** → **Install** → **Build**.

.. note::
    You can use either the wrapper script ``./raisin.sh`` (recommended) or call Python directly with ``python3 raisin.py``.

Step 1: Setup
-------------

The ``setup`` command generates interface files (.msg, .srv, .action) and configures CMake.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Setup all packages
    ./raisin.sh setup

    # Setup specific packages only
    ./raisin.sh setup raisin_network raisin_gui

**What it does:**

- Converts message definitions into header files
- Generates the master CMakeLists.txt file
- Organizes packages based on dependencies
- Creates release.txt with commit hashes
- Copies resource directories

Step 2: Install
---------------

The ``install`` command downloads and installs pre-compiled packages and their dependencies from GitHub releases.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install all packages from src/ directory
    ./raisin.sh install

    # Install specific packages (release version by default)
    ./raisin.sh install raisin_network
    ./raisin.sh install raisin_network raisin_gui

    # Install debug version
    ./raisin.sh install raisin_network --type debug
    ./raisin.sh install raisin_network -t debug

**With version constraints:**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install with version specifier
    ./raisin.sh install "raisin_core>=1.2.3"
    ./raisin.sh install "raisin_network>=2.0.0" --type debug

**Installation priority:**

1. Checks if the package is already installed in ``release/install/``
2. Checks if the package exists in local ``src/`` directory
3. Downloads the package from GitHub releases if not found locally

Dependencies are automatically resolved and installed recursively.

Step 3: Build
-------------

The ``build`` command compiles the project using CMake and Ninja.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Build release version
    ./raisin.sh build --type release

    # Build debug version
    ./raisin.sh build --type debug

    # Build both debug and release
    ./raisin.sh build --type debug --type release

    # Build and install artifacts to install/ directory
    ./raisin.sh build --type release --install

    # Build specific targets
    ./raisin.sh build --type release raisin_network

**Short form:**

.. code-block:: bash

    ./raisin.sh build -t release -i

**Complete workflow example:**

.. code-block:: bash

    # 1. Setup the workspace
    ./raisin.sh setup

    # 2. Install dependencies
    ./raisin.sh install

    # 3. Build the project
    ./raisin.sh build --type release --install

**Advanced: Manual CMake build (for expert users):**

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 raisin.py setup
    mkdir -p cmake-build-release
    cd cmake-build-release
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja
    ninja -j8 install

.. warning::
    Avoid building the project using sudo su, as it may lead to permission issues.

Index Commands
=================

The ``index`` command helps you list and discover available packages.

Index Local
-----------

Lists all packages in your local workspace and validates their dependency graph:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./raisin.sh index local

This command:

- Scans ``src/`` directory for source packages
- Scans ``release/install/`` for installed packages
- Validates dependency relationships
- Prints a colored report showing package status

Index Release
-------------

Lists available packages from GitHub releases:

.. code-block:: bash

    # List all available packages
    ./raisin.sh index release

    # List all versions of a specific package
    ./raisin.sh index release raisin_network

**Output includes:**

- Package names and versions
- Release vs prerelease status (prereleases shown in orange, releases in green)
- Available build types and platforms

Git Integration
=================

RAISIN provides Git commands to manage multiple repositories in the ``src/`` directory simultaneously.

Git Status
----------

Shows the sync status for all local repositories:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./raisin.sh git status

**Displays:**

- Current branch
- Commits ahead/behind remote
- Modified, staged, and untracked files
- Detailed status for each repository in ``src/``

Git Pull
--------

Pulls changes from remote for all repositories:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Pull from origin (default)
    ./raisin.sh git pull

    # Pull from specific remote
    ./raisin.sh git pull --remote upstream
    ./raisin.sh git pull -r upstream

Git Setup
---------

Configure git remotes for all repositories in ``src/``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Setup remotes with format remote_name:username
    ./raisin.sh git setup origin:raionrobotics dev:yourusername

    # This will configure each repository with:
    # - origin remote pointing to raionrobotics organization
    # - dev remote pointing to yourusername's fork

**Note:** This command clears existing remotes and sets up new ones based on the provided configuration.

Publishing Releases
====================

The ``publish`` command builds, packages, and uploads a release to GitHub.

**Basic usage:**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Publish release build (default)
    ./raisin.sh publish raisin_network

    # Publish debug build
    ./raisin.sh publish raisin_network --type debug
    ./raisin.sh publish raisin_network -t debug

**What it does:**

1. Runs setup for the target package
2. Builds the package with CMake and Ninja
3. Creates a compressed archive with naming format:
   ``{package}-{os}-{os_version}-{arch}-{build_type}-v{version}.zip``
4. Uploads the archive to the corresponding GitHub release
5. Handles version management and prerelease tagging

**Auto-confirm overwrites:**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Use --yes flag to skip overwrite confirmations
    ./raisin.sh publish raisin_network --yes
    ./raisin.sh publish raisin_network -y

**Note:** Prereleases are automatically overwritten without confirmation. Regular releases will prompt for confirmation unless ``--yes`` is specified.

Help & Documentation
====================

Get help for any command:

.. code-block:: bash

    # General help
    ./raisin.sh --help
    ./raisin.sh -h

    # Command-specific help
    ./raisin.sh build --help
    ./raisin.sh install -h
    ./raisin.sh publish --help
    ./raisin.sh git status -h

    # Custom help message
    ./raisin.sh help
