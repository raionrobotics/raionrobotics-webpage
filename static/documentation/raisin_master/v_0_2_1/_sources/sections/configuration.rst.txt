Configuration
=============

Raisin Master uses YAML configuration files to manage user settings, authentication, and repositories.

configuration_setting.yaml
--------------------------

This is the main configuration file. **It should never be committed to version control** as it contains sensitive tokens.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # configuration_setting.yaml
    user_type: devel  # Required: either 'user' or 'devel'

    gh_tokens:
      your-org: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      another-org: "ghp_yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"

    packages_to_ignore:
      - experimental_package
      - broken_package

**Fields:**

*   ``user_type`` (Required):
    *   ``'user'``: For consumers who mostly install pre-compiled packages.
    *   ``'devel'``: For developers who build from source and create releases.
*   ``gh_tokens`` (Optional): GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs). Keys are organization/owner names, values are the tokens. Required for accessing private repos and uploading releases.
*   ``packages_to_ignore`` (Optional): A list of package names in ``src/`` to exclude from the build.

repositories.yaml
-----------------

This file maps package names to their source Git repository URLs. It is essential for ``publish`` and ``install`` commands.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # repositories.yaml
    project_a:
      url: git@github.com:your-org/project_a.git
    project_b:
      url: git@github.com:your-org/project_b.git

Deprecated Configuration
------------------------

The following files are supported for backward compatibility but should not be used in new projects.

**secrets.yaml** (Deprecated)

Legacy file for GitHub tokens. Use ``configuration_setting.yaml`` instead.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # secrets.yaml
    gh_tokens:
      your-org: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    user_type: devel

**RAISIN_IGNORE** (Deprecated)

Legacy file for ignoring packages. Use ``packages_to_ignore`` in ``configuration_setting.yaml`` instead.

.. code-block:: text

    # RAISIN_IGNORE
    experimental_package
