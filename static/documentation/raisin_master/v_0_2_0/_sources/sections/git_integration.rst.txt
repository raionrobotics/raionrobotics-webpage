Git Integration
===============

Raisin provides powerful Git integration commands to manage multiple repositories in your project workspace. These commands help you keep all your source repositories synchronized and properly configured.

Overview
--------

The Git integration features allow you to:

* Check the status of all repositories in your workspace
* Pull updates from remote repositories
* Configure remotes for all repositories at once
* Track synchronization state across multiple remotes

All git commands automatically discover repositories in:

1. The project root directory (if it's a git repository)
2. All subdirectories under ``src/`` that contain a ``.git`` folder

Git Commands
------------

git status
^^^^^^^^^^

**Command:**

.. code-block:: shell

    python raisin.py git status

**Description:**

Fetches and displays a detailed synchronization status for all local repositories. This command provides a comprehensive view of how each repository compares to its remote counterparts.

**What it does:**

1. Discovers all git repositories in the current directory and ``src/``
2. For each repository, fetches the latest data from all remotes
3. Compares the local branch with each remote's corresponding branch
4. Displays a formatted table showing:

   * Repository name
   * Current branch
   * Status for each remote (synced, ahead, behind, or diverged)
   * Commit count differences

**Output format:**

The status display shows repositories grouped and sorted by owner, with color-coded status indicators:

* **Synced (✅)** - Local branch matches the remote
* **Ahead (⬆️ N)** - Local has N commits not yet pushed
* **Behind (⬇️ N)** - Remote has N commits not yet pulled
* **Diverged** - Local and remote have different commits
* **No remote** - The branch doesn't exist on that remote

**Example output:**

.. code-block:: text

    🔍 Scanning for git repositories...
    Found 5 repositories.

    📦 owner1/project_a
       Branch: main
       origin: ✅ Synced

    📦 owner1/project_b
       Branch: develop
       origin: ⬆️ 3 ahead
       upstream: ✅ Synced

    📦 owner2/project_c
       Branch: main
       origin: ⬇️ 2 behind
       fork: ⬆️ 1 ahead

git pull
^^^^^^^^

**Command:**

.. code-block:: shell

    python raisin.py git pull [remote]

**Description:**

Pulls changes for all local repositories from the specified remote. This command helps you quickly update all repositories in your workspace.

**Parameters:**

* ``remote`` (optional) - The name of the remote to pull from. Defaults to ``'origin'`` if not specified.

**What it does:**

1. Discovers all git repositories in the current directory and ``src/``
2. For each repository:

   a. Fetches updates from the specified remote
   b. Attempts to pull changes for the current branch
   c. Reports success or failure

3. Provides a summary of all pull operations

**Output format:**

.. code-block:: text

    --- Pull Summary ---
    ✅ project_a: Successfully pulled from origin
    ✅ project_b: Successfully pulled from origin
    ⚠️  project_c: Failed to pull (merge conflict)

**Usage examples:**

.. code-block:: shell

    # Pull from the default 'origin' remote
    python raisin.py git pull

    # Pull from an 'upstream' remote
    python raisin.py git pull upstream

    # Pull from a custom remote
    python raisin.py git pull raion

**Important notes:**

* This command will fail gracefully if there are merge conflicts
* It does not automatically resolve conflicts - you must resolve them manually
* The command uses authentication from ``configuration_setting.yaml`` for private repositories
* Only works with HTTPS remotes when using token authentication

git setup
^^^^^^^^^

**Command:**

.. code-block:: shell

    python raisin.py git setup <remote:user> [remote:user ...]

**Description:**

Clears all existing remotes and sets up new ones for all repositories in ``src/``. This command is particularly useful when you need to reconfigure remotes across multiple repositories, such as when forking projects or changing organizational structure.

**Parameters:**

* ``<remote:user>`` - One or more remote specifications in the format ``remotename:username``

  * ``remotename`` - The name of the remote (e.g., ``origin``, ``upstream``, ``fork``)
  * ``username`` - The GitHub username or organization name

**What it does:**

1. Scans all subdirectories in ``src/`` for git repositories
2. For each repository:

   a. Discovers the actual GitHub repository name from the existing ``origin`` remote URL
   b. **Removes all existing remotes** (this is a destructive operation)
   c. Adds new remotes based on the provided specifications
   d. Constructs remote URLs using SSH format: ``git@github.com:username/reponame.git``

3. Reports success or failure for each repository

**URL format:**

All remotes are configured using SSH URLs in the format:

.. code-block:: text

    git@github.com:<username>/<repository_name>.git

**Usage examples:**

**Example 1: Single remote**

Set up only an ``origin`` remote pointing to ``myusername``:

.. code-block:: shell

    python raisin.py git setup origin:myusername

Result for a repository named ``project_a``:

.. code-block:: text

    origin -> git@github.com:myusername/project_a.git

**Example 2: Multiple remotes**

Set up ``origin`` pointing to your fork and ``upstream`` pointing to the original:

.. code-block:: shell

    python raisin.py git setup origin:myusername upstream:originalorg

Results:

.. code-block:: text

    origin -> git@github.com:myusername/project_a.git
    upstream -> git@github.com:originalorg/project_a.git

**Example 3: Organization remotes**

Set up remotes for organization collaboration:

.. code-block:: shell

    python raisin.py git setup origin:raisim raion:raionrobotics

Results:

.. code-block:: text

    origin -> git@github.com:raisim/project_a.git
    raion -> git@github.com:raionrobotics/project_a.git

**Output format:**

.. code-block:: text

    Scanning for git repositories in '/path/to/project/src'...

    --- Configuring repository: project_a ---
    Discovered GitHub repository name: 'project_a'
    Removing all existing remotes...
    Removed remote: origin
    Adding remote 'origin' -> git@github.com:myusername/project_a.git
    Adding remote 'upstream' -> git@github.com:originalorg/project_a.git

    --- Configuring repository: project_b ---
    Discovered GitHub repository name: 'project_b'
    ...

**Important warnings:**

.. warning::

   This command is **destructive**! It removes ALL existing remotes before adding new ones. Make sure you have the correct remote specifications before running this command.

.. warning::

   This command uses SSH URLs. Ensure your SSH keys are properly configured with GitHub before using this command. See `GitHub's SSH key documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_ for setup instructions.

**Common use cases:**

1. **After forking repositories**: Reconfigure remotes to point to your fork as ``origin`` and the original as ``upstream``
2. **Changing organizations**: Update all remotes when transferring projects between organizations
3. **Standardizing remote names**: Ensure all repositories use consistent remote naming conventions
4. **Team onboarding**: Quickly configure a new developer's workspace with the correct remotes

**Troubleshooting:**

**Problem**: "Could not discover GitHub repository name"

**Solution**: The command couldn't parse the existing ``origin`` remote URL. This can happen if:

* The repository has no ``origin`` remote
* The ``origin`` URL is not a GitHub URL
* The URL format is non-standard

**Problem**: "Failed to add remote"

**Solution**: Check that:

* Your SSH keys are properly configured with GitHub
* The repository exists at the specified username/organization
* You have network connectivity to GitHub

**Problem**: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**Solution**: Your SSH keys are not properly configured. Follow GitHub's guide to add your SSH key to your GitHub account.

Authentication
--------------

Git commands that access remote repositories (``git status``, ``git pull``) use token authentication for HTTPS URLs.

**Configuration:**

Tokens are configured in ``configuration_setting.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    gh_tokens:
      github.com: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      your-org: "ghp_yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"

**Token requirements:**

* Tokens must have appropriate scopes:

  * ``repo`` - For accessing private repositories
  * ``read:org`` - For accessing organization repositories (if applicable)

**SSH vs HTTPS:**

* ``git setup`` command uses **SSH URLs** (``git@github.com:...``)
* ``git status`` and ``git pull`` can work with both SSH and HTTPS
* Token authentication only applies to HTTPS URLs
* SSH authentication uses your SSH keys

Best Practices
--------------

1. **Regular status checks**: Run ``git status`` frequently to stay aware of synchronization state
2. **Pull before pushing**: Always run ``git pull`` before pushing to avoid merge conflicts
3. **Consistent naming**: Use standard remote names (``origin``, ``upstream``, ``fork``) across all repositories
4. **Backup before setup**: The ``git setup`` command is destructive - ensure you have backups or know your remote URLs
5. **Use SSH for write operations**: SSH is more secure and convenient for push operations
6. **Keep tokens secure**: Never commit ``configuration_setting.yaml`` to version control

Workflow Examples
-----------------

**Daily development workflow:**

.. code-block:: shell
