Raisin Plugin - Autonomous Navigation System
====================================================================

**Raisin Plugin (Autonomous Navigation)** provides a complete autonomous navigation stack for quadrupedal robots.
It includes LiDAR drivers, SLAM, path planning, and a GUI interface for mission management.

This documentation covers the configuration and usage of autonomous navigation plugins including sensor drivers, state estimation, and path planning.

Key Features
------------

* **LiDAR Support**: Drivers for Ouster OS-1-32 and Livox Mid-360 LiDAR sensors
* **Depth Camera**: D455 depth camera for terrain perception
* **SLAM**: FAST-LIO LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for real-time localization and mapping
* **Terrain Mapping**: Grid mapping for terrain heightmap generation
* **Autonomous Navigation**: Waypoint navigation with terrain analysis and obstacle avoidance
* **Path Planning**: Local path planning with terrain traversability assessment
* **GUI Interface**: Interactive map window for mission planning and visualization
