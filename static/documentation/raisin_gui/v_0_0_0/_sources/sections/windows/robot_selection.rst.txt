   Robot Selection window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the top bar contains the connection controls, and the
main panel lists discovered robots. Selecting a robot reveals connection
actions, a short status summary, and optional diagnostics panes.

Layout
------

* Top bar: IP address book dropdown, manual IP entry field, and the WebSocket
  connect button.
* Device list: discovered robots with two status dots (heartbeat freshness and
  connection state), plus network type icons.
* Action row (for the selected robot): operator, developer, and disconnect
  buttons (or a connect button for disconnected entries).
* Details area: simulation vs real status, serial number, model, IP, and port,
  plus an optional description popup.
* Diagnostics area: four columns listing publishers, services, clients, and
  subscribers. Selecting an entry shows traffic plots below.

Key Controls
------------

* **WebSocket connect**: connects to ``<ip>:9002`` using the manual IP field.
* **Operator / Developer**: opens the ``robot`` or ``robot_dev`` window for the
  selected robot.
* **...**: opens the Robot Description popup with model and power limits.

Data Sources and Services
-------------------------

* Device discovery and connection status are derived from the Raisin network
  layer and heartbeat timing.
* Robot metadata is fetched via the ``describe_robot`` service.
* Traffic plots use per-topic counters from the active connection.

Notes
-----

* If a robot advertises multiple IPs, a dropdown appears to select the active
  endpoint.
* The diagnostics area reflects the currently selected connection; use it to
  verify topics before opening other windows.
