   Data logger window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the left column selects and loads log sessions, the
center column configures which fields to plot, and the right column renders
both plots and a 3D replay view.

Layout
------

* **Log directory panel**: choose the root directory and select a log session.
* **Load controls**: load a session and show progress/status messages.
* **Plot selection**: choose fields and divisions for each plot sheet.
* **Plot area**: multiple synchronized plots with a shared time axis.
* **3D replay**: Rayrai visualization of the robot state at the current time.
* **Time controls**: play/stop, speed multiplier, and range selection.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Add sheet / Remove sheet** manages multiple plot tabs.
* **Fit limits** auto-scales selected plots to the data range.
* **Play / Stop** animates the time cursor over recorded data.
* **Set as start / stop** defines a playback subsection.

Data Sources
------------

* Log data is read from ``raisin_data_logger`` directories containing
  ``.raisin_data`` files.
* The 3D replay uses the Raisim world definition corresponding to the device
  type encoded in the log directory name.

Notes
-----

* Large log files can take time to load; the progress bar indicates activity.
* Use fewer plot divisions if rendering becomes sluggish on large datasets.
