   Profile window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the top area shows live system indicators, while the
main panel lists function-level timing statistics and a bar chart of the most
expensive calls.

Layout
------

* **System indicators**: CPU, temperature, memory, and disk usage gauges.
* **Timing table**: sortable statistics for each profiled function.
* **Bar chart**: top functions ranked by total time.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* Click table headers to sort by name, count, total time, per-call time, or
  percentage of total computation.
* The bar chart labels are truncated in the plot; hover for full labels.

Data Sources
------------

* Subscribes to ``profile`` (``raisin_interfaces::msg::TimeProfile``) from the
  active connection.

Notes
-----

* Sorting by total time is useful for identifying compute bottlenecks.
* CPU temperature and memory usage reflect the robot system, not the GUI host.
