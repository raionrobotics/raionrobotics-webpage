   Sensor Set 1 window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the upper area is divided into optical and thermal
camera panels, while the lower area contains audio, pan/tilt, and flashlight
controls. Double-clicking a camera panel toggles a full-height view.

Layout
------

* **Refresh bar**: scans the connection for available optical and thermal
  topics.
* **Optical camera panel**: RGB streams plus an optical zoom slider.
* **Thermal camera panel**: thermal streams, sized to match the optical panel.
* **Microphone panel**: robot and operator microphone enable + volume controls.
* **Speaker panel**: robot and operator speaker enable + volume controls.
* **Pan/tilt panel**: sliders and quick buttons, plus a Go Home button.
* **Flashlight panel**: on/off toggle for the sensor head light.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Refresh sensors** builds topic lists from the active connection and
  instantiates camera widgets.
* **Optical zoom** calls ``/optical_set_zoom``.
* **Pan/tilt sliders** call ``/pan_tilt_set_manual_pan_target`` and
  ``/pan_tilt_set_manual_tilt_target`` with joint limits from ``SensorSet1``
  parameters.
* **Audio controls** manage robot/operator microphone and speaker states,
  including device selection and volume services.
* **Flashlight toggle** calls ``/turn_on_light`` and ``/turn_off_light``.

Data Sources and Services
-------------------------

* Camera discovery uses the connection publisher list and filters for
  ``optical_zoom_cam`` and ``boson`` topics carrying
  ``raisin_interfaces::msg::FfmpegPacket``.
* Status and volume updates subscribe to ``/robot_microphone_status``,
  ``/operator_microphone_status``, ``/robot_speaker_volume``, and related
  topics.

Notes
-----

* Double-click a camera panel to maximize it for detailed inspection.
* If a device list looks stale, click **Refresh sensors** to rebuild the
  topic list.
