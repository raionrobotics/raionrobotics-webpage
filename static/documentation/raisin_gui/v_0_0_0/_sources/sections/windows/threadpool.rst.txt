   Threadpool window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, each thread is shown with a pie chart summary and a
breakdown table of periodic and event tasks. The view helps diagnose scheduler
load and idle time.

Layout
------

* **Per-thread sections**: each thread shows a pie chart of execution time.
* **Task tables**: periodic and event task breakdowns with execution stats.
* **Idle time**: computed as the remainder of a 1-second budget.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* Pie chart slices correspond to task names and idle time.
* Tables show execution counts and average delays for periodic tasks.

Data Sources
------------

* Subscribes to ``threadpool`` (``raisin_interfaces::msg::ThreadPoolProfile``)
  from the active connection.

Notes
-----

* High idle time indicates available compute; sustained near-100% utilization
  suggests threadpool saturation.
