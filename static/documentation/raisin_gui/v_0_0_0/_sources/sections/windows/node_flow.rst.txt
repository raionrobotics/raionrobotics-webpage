Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the top bar contains filters and traffic metrics,
while the main area renders an interactive node graph of publish/subscribe and
service flows. Hovering pins and links reveals detailed rate and type
information.

Layout
------

* **Controls panel**: local/remote toggles, layout presets, filter fields, and
  focus/pin actions.
* **Traffic panel**: sortable table of message rates and byte rates for
  visible flows.
* **Node graph**: visualizes nodes, publishers, subscribers, clients, and
  services with directional links.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Local / Remote / Active Only** filters which flows are displayed.
* **Layout preset** chooses layered or radial layouts; manual mode disables
  auto-layout.
* **Filter fields** match nodes, topics, or message types.
* **Pin Selected** locks nodes in place; **Fit View** re-centers the graph.

Data Sources
------------

* Flow data is subscribed from ``node_flow``
  (``raisin_interfaces::msg::NodeFlow``).
* Message sizes and rates are derived from connection traffic statistics.

Notes
-----

* Use the traffic table to identify high-bandwidth topics before optimizing
  your pipeline.
* Pin critical nodes when using auto-layout to keep important layouts stable.
