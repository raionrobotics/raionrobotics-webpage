   Lock profiler window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the top row compares lock wait statistics by current
file and previous owner, while the bottom panel shows a histogram of wait-time
bins for the selected lock pair.

Layout
------

* **Log files**: list of ``raisin_lock_profiler`` logs.
* **Current File View**: aggregated wait times grouped by the current lock
  location.
* **Previous Owner View**: aggregated wait times grouped by the previous holder
  of the lock.
* **Histogram**: wait-time distribution for the selected lock pair.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* Selecting a log file parses the entries and populates the aggregates.
* Selecting a row updates the histogram for that lock pair.
* **Bin Count** slider changes histogram resolution.

Data Sources
------------

* Reads lock profiler logs from ``raisin_lock_profiler`` on disk.

Notes
-----

* Use the Current vs Previous views to distinguish where waits occur vs where
  locks are held too long.
