   Profile timeline window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the left column lists recorded time profile files, and
the right panel shows a scrollable timeline of execution spans. Each row
represents a function (optionally grouped by owner) and uses color to distinguish
tracks.

Layout
------

* **File list**: ``.raisin_time_profile`` logs from ``raisin_time_profile``.
* **File summary**: selected file name and entry count.
* **Timeline controls**: start position slider and grouping toggle.
* **Timeline table**: track labels, PIDs, and execution bars.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Group by owner** toggles whether tracks are grouped by function owner.
* **Start (s)** scrolls the visible time window.
* Drag or select within the timeline to inspect specific entries.

Data Sources
------------

* Reads profile logs from ``raisin_time_profile`` directories on disk.

Notes
-----

* Use the start slider to zoom into dense time ranges.
* When grouping is enabled, tracks are labeled as ``function [owner]`` to make
  multi-process activity clearer.
