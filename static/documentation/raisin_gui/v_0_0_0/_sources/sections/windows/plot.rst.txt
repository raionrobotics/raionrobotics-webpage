   Plot window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the left column is used to select topics and fields,
while the right side renders live plots. Tabs allow multiple plotting sheets.

Layout
------

* **Topic list**: all publishers from the active connection.
* **Plot sheets**: tabs for multiple plot layouts and selections.
* **Graph area**: live plots rendered with ImPlot.
* **Save/Load bar**: persistent storage of plot selections per device type.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Add sheet / Remove sheet** manage the number of plot tabs.
* **Time range** slider adjusts the horizontal window.
* **Save** stores the selected fields under
  ``$RAISIN_ROOT/raisin_gui_plot_window/<deviceType>/``.
* **Load** restores a previously saved configuration.

Data Sources
------------

* Subscriptions use ``any_message::msg::AnyMessageGraph`` to parse arbitrary
  message types from the active connection.

Notes
-----

* Use fewer sheets if you notice sluggish rendering on low-end GPUs.
* Saved selections are scoped by device type so multiple robots can have
  independent layouts.
