   Robot developer window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the top row is split into three columns: controls and
IMU on the left, 3D visualization in the center, and actuator/joystick widgets
on the right. The bottom row contains plugin management, joystick routing, and
a live log console.

Layout
------

* **Left column**: connection indicators, power/motor actions, home selection,
  stand/sit controls, IMU readout, and controller selection.
* **Center column**: Rayrai visualization with voltage/current/temperature
  bars.
* **Right column**: actuator table (position, velocity, effort, temperature,
  status) and joystick scaling sliders.
* **Bottom row**: plugin list with load/unload, joystick interface routing, and
  log output.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Connection indicators** show transport type (TCP/WEB), online state, and
  robot state.
* **Home selection** prompts for ``main`` or ``portable`` home before calling
  ``set_home_with_type``.
* **Controller list** highlights the currently loaded controller and provides a
  load button.
* **Plugin table** shows instance lists and load/unload actions.
* **Joy interface** lets you switch between manual and autonomy sources and
  send the ``set_listen`` command.

Data Sources and Services
-------------------------

* ``robot_state``, ``module_list``, and ``joy_range`` feed telemetry and UI
  state.
* ``gui_message`` populates the log console.
* ``describe_robot`` provides software version and metadata.
* Control services include ``turn_on``, ``turn_off``, ``init_motor``,
  ``stop_motor``, ``stand_up``, ``sit_down``, ``joint_test``,
  ``load_controller``, and ``load_plugin``.

Notes
-----

* The developer window uses the same safety checks as the operator window but
  exposes more raw controls and plugin state.
* Use the plugin table to manage multiple instances and unload unused plugins
  to reduce compute load.
