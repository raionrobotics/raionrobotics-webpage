   Password window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the window prompts for an ID and password before
opening the operator controls. The status area changes based on the password
policy response.

Layout
------

* **Status message**: indicates whether passwords are required, locked, or
  exceeded.
* **Credentials form**: ID and password fields with a submit button.
* **Notice text**: usage guidelines for remote operation.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Submit** calls the ``password`` service with the entered ID and password.
* Status updates are driven by the ``password_status`` topic.

Notes
-----

* If the password is accepted, the window closes and opens the operator view.
* Lockout messages include remaining time and attempt counts.
