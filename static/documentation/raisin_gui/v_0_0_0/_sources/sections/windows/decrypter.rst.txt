   Decrypter window.

Overview
--------

In the screenshot above, the left panel lists encrypted video logs, and the
right side shows the active decryption status and output messages.

Layout
------

* **File list**: encrypted ``.raisin_video`` files from
  ``raisin_recorded_videos``.
* **Decrypt action**: converts the selected file to ``.mp4``.
* **Progress indicator**: shows decode progress while running.
* **Result message**: shows success or error details.

Controls and Indicators
-----------------------

* **Decrypt** spawns a decoding thread, reads the encrypted stream, and writes
  a video file using OpenCV.
* The progress bar reflects the fraction of bytes processed.

Data Sources
------------

* Reads encrypted video logs from ``raisin_recorded_videos`` on disk.

Notes
-----

* Decrypted ``.mp4`` files are saved alongside the original logs.
* The window cleans up stale decrypted files on shutdown.
